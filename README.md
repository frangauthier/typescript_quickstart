## TypeScript + Koa quickstart

This project can be used as a basis for a project using TypeScript with the Koa framework.

### How to use

#### Prerequisites
1. To have NodeJs installed (version 14 recommended)
2. To have npm installed (should come with NodeJs)
3. To have TypeScript installed globally `npm install -g typescript`
4. (Optional) If you want to use *nodemon*, you must install *ts-node* globally: `npm install -g ts-node`

#### Configuration
1. Clone the project
2. Run `npm install` at the project root
3. (Optional) You can set the port server using the PORT environment variable: example - `set PORT=3000` in Windows or `export PORT=3000` in Linux

#### Running a server
To simply run the server: `npm run start`
To run the server with auto-refresh on code save, using *nodemon*: `npm run start:dev`
